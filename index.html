                <p>The goal of this project was to create a mechanism to create a kiosk for checkin and sign in. The overall idea was to create an centralized, low-cost system that 
                    would intake as much information as possible, and provide visibility for medical staff versus a traditional walk up method. Media Synthesis (the intake and OCR processing of images), combined with open-source solutioning is a viable intake
                    mechanism and a means to aggregate low-risk patients. However, there are some human determined elements in parsing data.
                    Using text completion models, such as ChatGPT (used in this project), parsing made it possible. However, this requires
                    precise prompt engineering and you do not get the same outcome twice.<br/><br/>
                    
                    The combination of OCR, and, facilitating patient intake would allow medical staff to focus on critical patients.
                    However, this applied project found that it would increase the patient experience for check in. Criticality is still
                    human deterministic and requires a large dataset for a classifier or recommendation model.
